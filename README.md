Repository containing portfolio of machine learning projects and weekly progress towards becoming better at Machine Learning algorithms.

# Week 1

### Pick a language, and in my opinion, Python is the best for this. 
Why? Easy syntax, extensive documentation, great community, availability of resources. 

### Create a GitHub profile and learn Git

Git is powerful version control system that every single person in STEM field should learn. GitHub is a way of showing world you know something. Simply writing I know Python will not be enough for companies. You have to prove you know the Python by showing of your projects.
